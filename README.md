# RTN Brand Assets

Canonical home for the Run The NumbersÃÂ® brand system. The full spec lives in [`DESIGN.md`](./DESIGN.md) in this repo (raw URL: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dean-yates/rtn-brand-assets/main/DESIGN.md>). This repo also hosts the visual files Ã¢ÂÂ logos, icons, covers Ã¢ÂÂ referenced across rtn.digital, the RTN Notion workspace, and automated deliverables.

> **Canonical source.** `DESIGN.md` in this repo is the single source of truth for the RTN brand system. The `rtn-branding` skill in `dean-yates/rtn-cowork` is a fast-loading cache of this spec; if anything in the skill contradicts `DESIGN.md`, the canonical wins.

Moved from Notion to GitHub on 20 May 2026. The old Notion `DESIGN.md` sub-page in the RTN Brand Guide teamspace is now a redirect stub pointing here.

## V2 Ledger design system (13 May 2026)

Primary accent: Ledger Blue `#2B4A7C`. Dark surface `#142544`. Canvas `#FAF7F2` (warm cream, never pure white). Text `#1B1A17` (warm near-black, never pure black). Replaces V1 (green / gunmetal / Nourd).

## Logo

V2 wordmark Ã¢ÂÂ decision recorded in Notion: [Logo design Ã¢ÂÂ V2 wordmark (decided)](https://www.notion.so/3678c4a62c3b8181b8a9d5187a2562c4). The mark is a single stacked lockup of "RTN" in Fraunces display cut with "RUN THE NUMBERSÃÂ®" tracked underneath in Geist Mono. Two SVG variant sets are provided:

- **Monogram** (`rtn-wordmark-*.svg`) â RTN glyphs only, no descriptor text. The descriptor is rendered live as type when room allows.
- **Full lockup** (`rtn-lockup-*.svg`) â RTN glyphs + "RUN THE NUMBERSÂ®" descriptor, stacked. For contexts where live type isn't available.

## Icons

34 hand-drawn-style SVG icons in Ledger Blue (`#2B4A7C`), rendered with rough.js to match the cover artwork. 64ÃÂ64 viewBox, single-pass strokes, slug-cased filenames.
